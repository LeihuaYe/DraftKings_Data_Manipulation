# DraftKings_Data_Manipulation

# Project Summary

In this post, I walk through my thinking strategy of picking players based on their recent performance at DraftKings. The repository contains the process of selecting players and balancing core players vis-a-vis value players. The entire writeup is available here at <https://towardsdatascience.com/optimize-draftkings-nba-lineups-using-data-manipulation-skills-fdf47b2a27e5>.

This repository hosts two datasets, R code, and a cheat sheet for data manipulation using dplyr in R.

## Installing

This project is conducted in the R environment, and the dplyr library is needed for data analysis. 

## What is the data?

The data is on the first post-season matchup between LA Lakers and Denver Nuggets on Sep. 18. There are two datasets: players' basic information (e.g., salary, name, position, average points, etc.) and game 1 statistics (e.g., actual points scored and the percentage drafted).
